# Yupiter

## Overview

Yupiter is a collection of specialized testing agents developed and maintained by the [QAPilot](https://qapilot.io) team. Each agent in the Yupiter series is named after a moon of Jupiter, reflecting the hierarchical and systematic approach to test automation.

## Project Philosophy

Just as Jupiter's moons orbit and serve specific purposes in the solar system, each agent in the Yupiter series is designed to handle specific testing scenarios and challenges. The project aims to create a comprehensive ecosystem of testing agents that work harmoniously together while maintaining individual specialization.

## Current Agents

## Development Guidelines

- Each agent should be named after a Jupiter moon
- Maintain consistent coding standards across all agents
- Include comprehensive documentation
- Provide unit tests for new features
- Follow semantic versioning

## Future Roadmap

- Integration of additional specialized testing agents
- Enhanced inter-agent communication
- Expanded platform support
- Advanced AI capabilities integration
