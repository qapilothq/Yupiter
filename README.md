# Yupiter

## Overview

Yupiter is a suite of specialized testing agents developed by the [QAPilot](https://qapilot.io) team. Each agent is named after a moon of Jupiter, symbolizing a structured approach to test automation. The repository is designed for easy management and addition of agents, each with unique functionalities.

## Project Philosophy

Yupiter is a unified ecosystem of intelligent testing agents, each designed to tackle specific challenges in software testing. Inspired by the structured harmony of Jupiter and its moons, Yupiter transforms fragmented, repetitive testing into an organized, scalable, and efficient process. Every agent plays a unique role—working together to bring speed, stability, and intelligence to modern software quality assurance.

## Current Agents

### Valetudo

- **Purpose**: Pop-up Handler Agent
- **Repository**: [Valetudo GitHub](https://github.com/qapilotio/Valetudo.git)
- **Features**:
  - Mobile screenshot analysis
  - XML data processing
  - Pop-up detection for Android devices
  - AI-powered suggestions using GPT-4o
  - FastAPI-based architecture

## Project Structure

Each agent is maintained as a separate repository and added as a submodule in this repository.

```
Yupiter/
├── Valetudo/           # Pop-up Handler Agent (submodule)
├── [Future Agent 1]/   # Reserved for future implementation (submodule)
├── [Future Agent 2]/   # Reserved for future implementation (submodule)
└── shared/             # Shared utilities and resources
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and initialize submodules:

   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/qapilotio/Yupiter.git
   cd Yupiter
   ```

2. Navigate to the specific agent directory:

   ```bash
   cd [agent-name]
   ```

3. Follow the individual agent README for setup instructions.

## Adding a New Agent

To add a new agent as a submodule:

1. Navigate to the root of the Yupiter repository.
2. Add the submodule:

   ```bash
   git submodule add [agent-repo-url] [agent-name]
   ```

3. Initialize and update the submodule:

   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

4. Commit the changes:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add [agent-name] as a submodule"
   ```

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
